# iefrei-eat

A Flask app built for Efrei Students that want to eat something for the Boulangerie. 
This was even a test to check what Flask can do in a fullstack app. Then I got my answer..
Each student could order something and they were delivered within 10-25mins.
The project has been aborted because of the incapacity of certain students to keep their words, and as a result, sometimes they canceled there order just before getting delivrered. This problem can be solved, but no thank u.
